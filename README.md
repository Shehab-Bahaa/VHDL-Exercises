# VHDL-Exercises
To practice FPGA digital design using VHDL, I used the laboratory exercises provided by intel FPGAcademy for the Digital Logic course. Terasic DE0-CV Board (Altera Cyclone V FPGA device) was used during the labs.
The labs involved the following topics:
  - Switches, LEDS, and Multiplexers
  - Numbers and Displays
  - Latches, Flip-flops and Registers
  - Counters
  - Timers and Real-Time Clocks
  - Adders, Subtracters, and Multipliers
  - Finite State Machines
  - Memory Blocks

In each lab directory, there will be the following:  
  - the lab requirements (pdf file)  
  - RTL files (.vhd), testbench file (_tb.vhd), and Intel Quartus Prime files (.qsf, .qpf, and .sdc) for each part of the lab

These labs have been done as part of my internship at PyramidTech during Summer 2022.
